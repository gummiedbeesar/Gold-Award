                    <p class="para"> The cool part about college applications is that apart from essays, they are all the same. They ask for your personal information, family, education, and awards.
                      If you use things like CommonApp or Scoir, the most common streamlined college applications, you will come across these questions. Furthermore, it will get either annoying or rewarding depending on where you are in the process.
                      For many people, if you are in the stage of your application where you are <i>only</i> filling in this information, it gets annoying very quickly. But, when you get
                      to the part of yout journey where you are only writing 500-600 word essays, this part magically becomes less annoying.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"> I created this template after filling out many college and scholarship applications. Most of them asked questions like these which while they were not
                      difficult to answer, they weren't easily remembered. For instance, I know my name by heart (yay!) but I don't know the exact date I started my summer job. Another use for this is
                      keeping your information consistant, like club hours, rather than trying to calculate each time. Most times when you are asked about club participation it is asked in hours per week and weeks per year.
                      Some clubs meet for different times depending on the year, so it's harder to provide an average to stick with. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BLATANTLY LIE BY OVEREXAGGERATING.

                    <p class="para"> When doing college essays, it is important to keep everything organized. Here is the template I created and used throughout my application process. 
                      I made it so that you won't have to move back and forth between tabs, and also so that your work is being saved in a seperate location from the application portal. This way you can easily share it with anyone you want to review it
                       and keep track of your progress. Another reason is that I was a little paranoid that I would accidentally submit an unfinished essay.

                      This is a Notion I created that serves as a baseline templete for the college research and application process. Once you duplicate it, you are able to edit whatever you want. Based on my Matriculate Advising Fellow and other students who have graduated, I created a quick guide
                      to how to look for colleges.

                    <p class="para"> Because this process is different for every person, this template is not meant to be the "One and Only Way". It is a starting point that you can 
                      use and approve upon to better fit your journey. One of the most stressful parts of this process is not having a definite starting point, so I wanted to create one for people to use. It is going to be a lot of info, so I recommend looking at it as early as possible so it is less overwhelming when you begin senior year. (PS: The Notion does not look exactly that PDF)
