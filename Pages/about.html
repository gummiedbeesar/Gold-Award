                    Hello! My name is Kennedi and I am the creator of this project! Since the 8th grade, I have
                    been obsessed with college move-in vlogs. I would watch hours of content thinking,
                    ‚ÄúWow that&#39s such a long time from now‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat&#39s so cool!‚Äù. Now, though, I have experienced the true stress of college season and find it is not
                    that cool and has come a little (much) too quickly. 
                </p>
                <p class="para">These are my origins, but what truly inspired me to create this was seeing the mental
                    toll it was taking on my peers. In my junior year, I wanted to create a resource that 
                    would help people research colleges. I made a template on Notion and thought it was a 
                    done deal. Luckily (üòê), junior year was very busy so I decided to postpone my project to 
                    senior year. After living through the entire process, I felt that this tool needed to be 
                    broader. I realized that a lot of the college process is unknown, and that is what makes 
                    it so scary. No matter when you start, you will feel behind or discouraged. Deadlines feel 
                    like they are far away until they are around the corner. The personal essay feels impossible 
                    to write (I mean, seriously, who came up with that.) Most of all, everyone is asking, 
                    ‚ÄúSo what school do you want to go to?‚Äù and you have to awkwardly answer, ‚ÄúOh haha, I don&#39t 
                    know yet‚Äù and then they either say, ‚ÄúOh it&#39s okay! You have plenty of time‚Äù or  
                    ‚ÄúIt&#39s almost time to apply!‚Äù then you have to laugh it off and hope they don&#39t bring it 
                    up again because 11th grade felt like just yesterday and you didn&#39t fully realize how fast 
                    this whole thing would creep up on you. Hahaha! Right? What was I saying?

                <p class = "para">I created this website to provide starting points for students interested in pursuing a

                    counselors, undergraduate advisors, friends, recent high school graduates, and YouTube. 
                    There are links to a lot of helpful resources with explanations of how to use them. 
                    Lastly, there are some templates I created that could help throughout your application 
                    process.

            I learned about QuestBridge‚Äôs National College Match during my junior year.
             The College Match is a program where students can apply to up to 
             <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/college-partners" class="para" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 partnered schools</a> 
             for free and if they ‚Äúmatch‚Äù with (are accepted into) a school, they receive the 
             QuestBridge Scholarship which covers housing and tuition for all four years 
             (for the most part). In simple terms, applicants get a chance to receive a nearly 
             full-ride scholarship to some of the top schools in the United States. Questbridge 
             works as another form of Early Decision; during the process, you are not allowed to 
             apply to other schools during their early rounds unless it meets one of the criteria 
             listed on the QuestBridge website. For me, I applied early (not Early Decision) to the 
             University of Memphis and the University of Tennessee - Knoxville because they fell into the allowed scenarios. 
    </p><p class="para">The QuestBridge process was very difficult and time-consuming, but well worth it. 
        The first part of the application was the application for QuestBridge. This opened in early August and was due in late September. It included some typical college application questions and eleven open-response questions to get to know you better. The questions varied in word count with some being limited to 35 words while another was limited to 800 words. After completing this portion you receive the decision of whether you are a Finalist or not by mid-October. 
    </p><p class = "para">If you don‚Äôt become a finalist, you are still able to apply to some of the 
        schools partnered with QuestBridge with the QuestBridge Application. You are also allowed to 
        apply to other schools Early Decision or Early Action. If you aren‚Äôt a Finalist, though, you may 
        have to submit application fees.
    </p><p class = "para">I became a Finalist and moved on the the next portion of 
        the National College Match Process: finalizing the order of my ranked schools and completing 
        any required supplementals. When you become a finalist, the schools will reach out to you 
        about accessing your portal. Then you have to complete EVERY supplemental for EVERY school 
        you ranked. It is very important to note that when you are ranking your schools you need to 
        think about a few things. Does the school have what I‚Äôm looking for? If you already know what 
        you want to study and the school does not offer that, you should reconsider whether you want 
        to rank them as a school. Do I want to go to the school? You should think about whether you 
        actually want to attend the school. They are all great schools, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but not 
        every school is perfect for everyone. If you Match with a school, you MUST attend, so really 
        consider the previous two factors. And finally, will I be able to complete the supplementals 
        needed? I ranked 6 schools: Northwestern University, The University of Chicago, 
        Stanford University, the University of South California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
        and Columbia University in the City of New York. I had about 19 supplementals. 
        Most were not more than 500 words, but the University of Chicago required an essay 
        that was around 1-2 pages. The lengths and types of questions vary from school to school.  
        The University of Southern California asked me quick questions like what my favorite 
        snack was or what show I would binge next. You also need to complete the financial aid 
        documents (the CSS Profile and FAFSA). This was all due by November 1st, the typical 
        Early Decision deadline for schools. There was not much time between receiving the news 
        that I was a finalist to submitting all the required materials, so I highly recommend 
        looking at all the schools beforehand to see what they will ask for.
    </p><p class = "para">The next big date is December 1st, also known as Match Day. 
        This is the day that you find out if you matched/who you matched with. When you rank schools, 
        you are ranking them in the order of favorite to least favorite (of the schools you chose). 
        The school you match with is the school that accepts you and is the highest on your list. 
        Let‚Äôs say a student ranks 4 schools and they match with their 3rd choice. This means that 
        the student was not accepted into their 1st or 2nd choice, but was accepted to their 3rd. 
        This also means that the student will not know if they were accepted or rejected from their 
        4th choice. While yes, it‚Äôs possible School 4 accepted the student, because the student
         had School 3 ranked above School 4, they Match with School 3. 
    </p><p class = "para">If you don't match, this is not the end of ANYTHING. 
        You can roll your application over to the Regular Decision round and apply 
        to schools without restrictions placed by QuestBridge. You also still have the title of 
        ‚ÄúNational College Match Finalist‚Äù. I am very thankful to have Matched with my number 
        one choice, Northwestern University! When I found out, I was elated! I can honestly say 
        that the entire journey, from August to December, was SO worth it.
    </p><p class = "para"></p>Even after Match Day, there is more to do. Most, if not all, 
    schools will require you to keep up your academic record. Just because you Match does 
    not mean your spot is unconditionally guaranteed. No matter how academic you are, senioritis 
    is very real. Along with this, each school and QuestBridge will have some smaller things that 
    need to be completed, so it is important to keep an eye out for those.
</p><p class = "para">I know I‚Äôve been rambling on for a while now, but the final thing I 
    want to say is, ‚ÄúYou got this.‚Äù This process is hard. It takes a lot of time, work, and energy.
     It‚Äôs going to feel like you are the only one stressed. It‚Äôs going to feel like you are behind. 
     It‚Äôs going to feel like you aren‚Äôt ready. But none of that is true. When I became a Finalist, 
     I read a lot of the introductions people made and started to feel discouraged. I felt not 
     qualified enough, and that only made me more nervous. I decided to stop reading those intros
      and focus more on how I wanted to present myself. Be proud of yourself for just putting
       yourself out there. You are great, and you can do this. Don‚Äôt give up. This all sounds 
       clich√©, but it is genuinely the best advice I can give you. I can‚Äôt help you write an 
       essay, I can‚Äôt tell you what ACT, GPA, and Extracurricular activity
        combination will guarantee your admission into every school. 
        I can only tell you to try your best and be true to yourself.
