                    Hello! My name is Kennedi and I am the creator of this project! Since the 8th grade, I have
                    been obsessed with college move-in vlogs. I would watch hours of content thinking,
                    “Wow that&#39s such a long time from now” and “That&#39s so cool!”. Now, though, I have experienced the true stress of college season and find it is not
                    that cool and has come a little (much) too quickly. 
                    <br><br>These are my origins, but what truly inspired me to create this was seeing the mental
                    toll it was taking on my peers. In my junior year, I wanted to create a resource that 
                    would help people research colleges. I made a template on Notion and thought it was a 
                    done deal. Luckily (😐), junior year was very busy so I decided to postpone my project to 
                    senior year. After living through the entire process, I felt that this tool needed to be 
                    broader. I realized that a lot of the college process is unknown, and that is what makes 
                    it so scary. No matter when you start, you will feel behind or discouraged. Deadlines feel 
                    like they are far away until they are around the corner. The personal essay feels impossible 
                    to write (I mean, seriously, who came up with that.) Most of all, everyone is asking, 
                    “So what school do you want to go to?” and you have to awkwardly answer, “Oh haha, I don&#39t 
                    know yet” and then they either say, “Oh it&#39s okay! You have plenty of time” or  
                    “It&#39s almost time to apply!” then you have to laugh it off and hope they don&#39t bring it 
                    up again because 11th grade felt like just yesterday and you didn&#39t fully realize how fast 
                    this whole thing would creep up on you. Hahaha! Right? What was I saying?

                <p>I created this website to provide starting points for students interested in pursuing a 
                    4-year postsecondary institution. There are some tips and information from myself, 
                    counselors, undergraduate advisors, friends, recent high school graduates, and YouTube. 
                    There are links to a lot of helpful resources with explanations of how to use them. 
                    Lastly, there are some templates I created that could help throughout your application 
                    process.
                    <br><br>I hope this helps, even if it's only a little. I believe in you, and good luck!
