                <p>This is a worksheet that the ACT has for students to use to research a college. I feel that this is a great starting point for when you are initially researching colleges. After you have put together a list of schools that meet your overall criteria, you can begin to narrow it down by seeing what schools offer/have the specific things you are looking for in a school.</p>

                <p>BigFuture has a really useful CollegeSearch tool! CollegeBoard also shows you what AP credits transfer to what college/university.

                <p>College Rover is most helpful for comparing colleges side-by-side. The most helpful parts of this website has been pay-walled. There are ways to get around it, but I cannot give that information here.</p>

                <p> Niche was the most helpful resource for me. It is very helpful to use when looking for how schools rank in certain categories (whether it be by a specific major or by "Best Food").</p>

                <p> CollegeVine is another website that can help you find schools in bulk that you can screen through to see if you want to add them to your list or not.</p>

                <p> NCES is more data heavy and not as user friendly as the other resources listed. It is helpful, though, because you can see statistics about schools from the government.</p>

                <p> There is no link for the Common Data Set because you can find it for each individual school by searching "[school name] common data set". The CDS can show you demographics and what they are looking for in applications. </p>

                <p> QuestBridge is a program that allows students to match with highly selective schools and receive near-full-ride scholarships to the schools. If you are low income and interested in those top schools, I definitely think you should look into QuestBridge. </p>
