                <p>There is no "right" or "wrong" way to use this tool. The college research and application process is different for everyone. If you see something that you think will benefit you, have at it!
                    And if you see something that you feel won't be helpful, ignore it! I have provided some basic templates that you can use as a starting point, but this tool is all about what works for YOU!</p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said, I do have suggestions based on my experience :D
