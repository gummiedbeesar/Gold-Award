                <p> I created this website so that students can have easy access to resources that could be helpful throughout the
                    college research and application process. Based on some research and personal experiences I have created documents and compiled as much helpful information as I could. 
                    <br>However, <b>I cannot review applications/essays or guarentee acceptance into any university because I am not qualified to do so.</b> The purpose of this website is to provide resources that can reduce stress during the college descision and application process.</p>
                <p><em>Note: I know the website is a little clunky, hopefully I can improve it in the future!</em></p>

                <p>There is no "right" or "wrong" way to use this tool. The college research and application process is different for everyone. If you see something that you think will benefit you, have at it!
                    And if you see something that you feel won't be helpful, ignore it! I have provided some basic templates that you can use as a starting point, but this tool is all about what works for YOU!</p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said, I do have suggestions based on my experience :D
