      <p> DISCLAIMER: This website does not guarantee your admission into ANY school.
        It also is not guaranteed to eliminate the stress related to the college decision and application 
        process (but I really wish it could). This website <em> does </em>, however, provide resources 
        and information relating to the process so that it is less stressful. It can define frequently used 
        terms, link websites for research, share templates to help you organize, and talk about my 
        personal experiences. I cannot give application advice or review essays. Additionally, all information
      here is not professional. These are my personal opinions. The advice section is also based on other people's
    opinions.</p>
    <p> TLDR: Take everything with a mole of NaCl...(That's like 902 grains)</p>
